Hello, everyone. My name is Andrei and I am a mechanical engineer from Belarus. I am 35 years old and I studied at the Belarusian National Technical University. I am currently engaged in the repair of lifting and storage equipment.

I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can improve our lives. I have also been curious about how things work and how they are designed. That is why I chose to become a mechanical engineer and work with machines.

However, recently I have developed a new interest in programming. I think programming is a very useful and creative skill that can open up many possibilities and opportunities. I want to learn how to create websites and applications that can solve problems, provide information, and entertain people.

That is why I decided to join the Front-end developer courses at RS School. I have no prior experience in programming, but I am eager to learn and challenge myself. I hope to gain the knowledge and skills that will enable me to become a competent and confident front-end developer.

I am looking forward to learning from the mentors and the fellow students at RS School. I am also excited to work on projects and assignments that will help me practice and improve my programming abilities. I believe that RS School is a great place to start my journey as a programmer.

Unfortunately, I do not speak English, but in the in the near future I want to learn it. I think English is an important language for programmers and for communicating with people from different countries and cultures.

The most interesting task, in my opinion, was a random game on stage 0. In this task, I made a "15" game. It was interesting and challenging to create a game from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned a lot from this task.

One of the main difficulties in studying at the RS School course is the lack of time due to the main job. However, this did not prevent me from completing all the tasks on time. I am proud of my dedication and perseverance in pursuing my goals.

Thank you for reading my self-presentation.
